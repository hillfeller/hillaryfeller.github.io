Budding web developer with solid ruby on rails foundations, currently exploring both front end and back end development, and continuously learning web development skills. This includes an eagerness to contribute, as well as offer troubleshooting insight. Additionally, I have an educational background in cyber security.

After receiving a master of science in cyber security, I began work as a technical analyst at a software company called AvePoint. At AvePoint, prior to my interest in web development, I was both a senior technical analyst and later manager of a team of analysts. It was during this position as an analyst that I became increasingly interested in mastering a programming language.

While troubleshooting our proprietary application, and observing its complex relationship with SharePoint, I worked with our development team to interpret the logs collected from our application, in order to determine if any of the technical issues at hand were perhaps rooted in the C# or Java used to retrieve SharePoint APIs. It was at the point of C# code dissection, it became clear that remaining in a managerial position would no longer satiate my technical curiosity.

While working at AvePoint, I enrolled in an apprenticeship with Bloc.io. After having completed the Bloc coursework, I consider myself to be well versed in Ruby on Rails (as well as CSS and HTML5), and am very comfortable using GitHub. The rails skills which I have implemented include CRUD actions, the model-view-controller architecture, including but not limited to authenticating and authorizing users, signing in, and creating public profiles, among other application features. Additionally, a significant element of what I have focused on during the rails apprenticeship is TDD with RSpec. After using TDD, it became abundantly clear how significant the role of testing plays in the development world. The troubleshooting, and problem solving experience acquired at AvePoint has become invaluable.


I have been told that I am a fast learner, and as I am very much looking forward to starting a career in web development. Thank you for your consideration.
