## Explanation

This application is a boilerplate template for an application that has similar functionality to reddit. It allows users to create topics, post on the topic, comment on the post, like, favorite, and up vote and down vote items. Additionally, it provides authentication and authorization. An additional feature that would be useful to add is a user activity feed.
