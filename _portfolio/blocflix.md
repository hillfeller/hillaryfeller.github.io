## Explanation

I have always been intrigued by the connection between joint pain and the weather. After building a strong rails foundation, I hoped to create a user community application that would flourish, as many people can relate to the problem of painful joints due to changes in the weather.

## Problem

After creating the basic functionality of this application, I came to the realization that not only would it build a relatable user community, it has great gaming potential.

## Solution

With limited knowledge of implementing gaming APIs, I decided to utilize a labeling functionality that would maintain a count of the number of times that a user specified 'rain', or 'shine', among other labels.

## Results

While not the most elegant solution, I was able to create a responsive working bar graph that is indicative of how many times a user has made a specific label selection.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, I would like to continue to develop this application, and implement a more competitive gaming feature, in which users would be able to hedge their bets on the forecast, in order to determine which ailments are the most accurate.
